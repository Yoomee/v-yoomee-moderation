= Yoomee-moderation

A simple flagging system for moderating content on a site. The gem provides a helper method to generate a flag link that users (logged-in or not) can click to report inappropriate content. Once clicked, a lightbox will appear for them to enter a brief message.

  yoomee_flag_link(@asset, :text => "Flag this photo as offensive", :class => "flag-photo")

An administrator is notified by email for each new flagging and all the flaggings can be viewed by admins in the moderation area ('/moderation/home' or moderation_path).
